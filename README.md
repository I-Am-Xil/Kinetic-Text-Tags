# Kinetic-Text-Tags
 Text Tags that add various effects to Ren'py text!

Ever felt the text in your visual novel is looking a bit too static?
Ever want to spice it up with a little flair?
Or feeling a line needs a little more OOMPH!! to get the job done?

Then look no further! Through the power of Custom Text Tags, you can add any translation, rotation, projection, or styling you want on the fly!!
You can even change the text and stack multiple effects together.
You can even have your text react to the mouse a little if you'd like!
Just add some Kinetic Text Tags to your Ren'py project and you'll be flinging text around the screen like a wizard in no time!

To use what I've made or to learn how to create your own, simply include **[kinetic_text_tags.rpy](https://github.com/SoDaRa/Kinetic-Text-Tags/blob/main/game/kinetic_text_tags.rpy)** in your project and read over the code and comments for how you can get started and to learn how it works.
And if you have any questions feel free to inquire. 

I've included some basic examples to help you get your mind humming with what's possible with these. For more thorough documentation, feel free to check the forum post here for an overview of how it works, its limitations and other info.
I'll probably add that stuff here later. But it's a lot to go over and I've never made a GitHub README before...
For now you can read more about it in my post on the Lemma Soft Forums https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=51&t=60527
